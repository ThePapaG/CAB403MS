# CAB403MS
Cab403 final assignment mine sweeper server and client

## Compilation and Run
An appropriate makefile structure has been written for the different components.

To make the assignment as a whole locate the root directory and run:

_make_

This will make _server.exe_ and _client.exe_ in their root directories. To run these components please execute the command line tools;

**Server**

_./Server/server PORT_

Where _PORT_ is the port you wish to open the server on.

**Client**

_./Client/client HOST_IP PORT_

Where _HOST_IP_ is the ip of the server host (localhost if on the same machine), and _PORT_ is the port that the client is to connect to the server on.
